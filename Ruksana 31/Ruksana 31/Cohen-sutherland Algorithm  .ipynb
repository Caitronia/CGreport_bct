    "# Algorithm: Line Clipping Using Rectangular Window\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input** the coordinates of the rectangular clipping window:  \n",
    "   `xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input** the coordinates of the line endpoints:  \n",
    "   `P1(x1, y1)` and `P2(x2, y2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compare** the position of both endpoints with the clipping window boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **If both endpoints lie completely inside** the clipping window  \n",
    "   `(xmin ≤ x ≤ xmax and ymin ≤ y ≤ ymax)`,  \n",
    "   then **accept the line** and draw it as a **solid line**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **If both endpoints lie completely outside** the clipping window on the **same side**,  \n",
    "   then **reject the line** and draw it as a **dotted line**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **If one endpoint lies inside** the clipping window and the other lies outside,  \n",
    "   then the line is **partially visible**.  \n",
    "   - Compute the **intersection point** with the clipping window boundary.  \n",
    "   - Draw the **inside portion** as a **solid line** and the **outside portion** as a **dotted line**.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **If both endpoints lie outside** the clipping window but the line **intersects the window at two points**,  \n",
    "   - Compute both **intersection points**.  \n",
    "   - Draw the portion of the line **inside the window** as a **solid line** and the **remaining portions** as **dotted lines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Display** the clipping window along with the **accepted** and **rejected** portions of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Stop**"
