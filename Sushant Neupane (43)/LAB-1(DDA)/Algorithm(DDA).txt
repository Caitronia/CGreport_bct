DDA Algorithm

Step 1: Input the starting and ending coordinates of the line
	(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)

Step 2: Calculate the differences
	Δx = x2 - x1
	Δy = y2 - y1

Step 3: Determine the number of steps
	Steps = max(|Δx|, |Δy|)

Step 4: Calculate the increments
	Xinc=Δx/steps
	Yinc=Δy/steps

Step 5: Initialize the starting point: x=x1, y=y1

Step 6: Iterate through the number of steps 
	a) plot the points (round(x1),round(y1))
	b) x=x+Xinc
	    y=y+Yinc
Step 7: End
