1. Input the coordinates of the start point (x1, y1) and end point (x2, y2).
2. Calculate differences:
   dx = x2 - x1
   dy = y2 - y1
3. Determine the number of steps:
   steps = max(abs(dx), abs(dy))
4. Calculate increments for each step:
   x_inc = dx / steps
   y_inc = dy / steps
5. Set starting point:
   x = x1
   y = y1
6. For each step:
   - Plot (round(x), round(y))
   - x = x + x_inc
   - y = y + y_inc
7. End.
